<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Consider this, fair youth, and know that in the friendship of the lover there is no real kindness; he has an appetite and wants to feed upon you:</p><p>'As wolves love lambs so lovers love their loves.'</p><p>But I told you so, I am speaking in verse, and therefore I had better make an end; enough.</p><p>PHAEDRUS: I thought that you were only half-way and were going to make a similar speech about all the advantages of accepting the non-lover. Why do you not proceed?</p><p>SOCRATES: Does not your simplicity observe that I have got out of dithyrambics into heroics, when only uttering a censure on the lover? And if I am to add the praises of the non-lover what will become of me? Do you not perceive that I am already overtaken by the Nymphs to whom you have mischievously exposed me?</p></div> </div>
