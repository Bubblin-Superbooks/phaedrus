<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Socrates, who has risen, recognizes the oracular sign which forbids him to depart until he has done penance. His conscious has been awakened, and like Stesichorus when he had reviled the lovely Helen he will sing a palinode for having blasphemed the majesty of love. His palinode takes the form of a myth.</p><p>Socrates begins his tale with a glorification of madness, which he divides into four kinds: first, there is the art of divination or prophecy&mdash;this, in a vein similar to that pervading the Cratylus and Io, he connects with madness by an etymological explanation (mantike, manike&mdash;compare oionoistike, oionistike, ''tis all one reckoning, save the phrase is a little variations'); secondly, there is the art of purification by mysteries; thirdly, poetry or the inspiration of the Muses (compare Ion), without which no man can enter their temple.</p></div> </div>
