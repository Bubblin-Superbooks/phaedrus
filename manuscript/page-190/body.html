<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And this state, my dear imaginary youth to whom I am talking, is by men called love, and among the gods has a name at which you, in your simplicity, may be inclined to mock; there are two lines in the apocryphal writings of Homer in which the name occurs. One of them is rather outrageous, and not altogether metrical. They are as follows:</p><p>'Mortals call him fluttering love, But the immortals call him winged one, Because the growing of wings (Or, reading pterothoiton, 'the movement of wings.') is a necessity to him.'</p><p>You may believe this, but not unless you like. At any rate the loves of lovers and their causes are such as I have described.</p></div> </div>
