The natural process will be far nobler, and will bring forth fruit in the minds of others as well as in his own.</p><p>The conclusion of the whole matter is just this,&mdash;that until a man knows the truth, and the manner of adapting the truth to the natures of other men, he cannot be a good orator; also, that the living is better than the written word, and that the principles of justice and truth when delivered by word of mouth are the legitimate offspring of a man's own bosom, and their lawful descendants take up their abode in others.</p></div> </div>
