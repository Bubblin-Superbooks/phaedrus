I would except Simmias the Theban, but all the rest are far behind you. And now I do verily believe that you have been the cause of another.</p><p>PHAEDRUS: That is good news. But what do you mean?</p><p>SOCRATES: I mean to say that as I was about to cross the stream the usual sign was given to me,&mdash;that sign which always forbids, but never bids, me to do anything which I am going to do; and I thought that I heard a voice saying in my ear that I had been guilty of impiety, and that I must not go away until I had made an atonement.</p></div> </div>
