I remember Prodicus laughing when I told him of this; he said that he had himself discovered the true rule of art, which was to be neither long nor short, but of a convenient length.</p><p>PHAEDRUS: Well done, Prodicus!</p><p>SOCRATES: Then there is Hippias the Elean stranger, who probably agrees with him.</p></div> </div>
