Why do I say so? Why, because I perceive that my bosom is full, and that I could make another speech as good as that of Lysias, and different. Now I am certain that this is not an invention of my own, who am well aware that I know nothing, and therefore I can only infer that I have been filled through the ears, like a pitcher, from the waters of another, though I have actually forgotten in my stupidity who was my informant.</p><p>PHAEDRUS: That is grand:&mdash;but never mind where you heard the discourse or from whom; let that be a mystery not to be divulged even at my earnest desire.</p></div> </div>
