During this process the whole soul is all in a state of ebullition and effervescence,&mdash;which may be compared to the irritation and uneasiness in the gums at the time of cutting teeth,&mdash;bubbles up, and has a feeling of uneasiness and tickling; but when in like manner the soul is beginning to grow wings, the beauty of the beloved meets her eye and she receives the sensible warm motion of particles which flow towards her, therefore called emotion (imeros), and is refreshed and warmed by them, and then she ceases from her pain with joy.</p></div> </div>
