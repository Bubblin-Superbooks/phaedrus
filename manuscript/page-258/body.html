<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: I dare say that you are familiar with Tisias. Does he not define probability to be that which the many think?</p><p>PHAEDRUS: Certainly, he does.</p><p>SOCRATES: I believe that he has a clever and ingenious case of this sort:&mdash;He supposes a feeble and valiant man to have assaulted a strong and cowardly one, and to have robbed him of his coat or of something or other; he is brought into court, and then Tisias says that both parties should tell lies: the coward should say that he was assaulted by more men than one; the other should prove that they were alone, and should argue thus: 'How could a weak man like me have assaulted a strong man like him?' The complainant will not like to confess his own cowardice, and will therefore invent some other lie which his adversary will thus gain an opportunity of refuting. And there are other devices of the same kind which have a place in the system. Am I not right, Phaedrus?</p></div> </div>
