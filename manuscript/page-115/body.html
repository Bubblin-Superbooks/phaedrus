<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>PHAEDRUS: My tale, Socrates, is one of your sort, for love was the theme which occupied us&mdash;love after a fashion: Lysias has been writing about a fair youth who was being tempted, but not by a lover; and this was the point: he ingeniously proved that the non-lover should be accepted rather than the lover.</p><p>SOCRATES: O that is noble of him! I wish that he would say the poor man rather than the rich, and the old man rather than the young one;&mdash;then he would meet the case of me and of many a man; his words would be quite refreshing, and he would be a public benefactor. For my part, I do so long to hear his speech, that if you walk all the way to Megara, and when you have reached the wall come back, as Herodicus recommends, without going in, I will keep you company.</p></div> </div>
