<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But he who, having no touch of the Muses' madness in his soul, comes to the door and thinks that he will get into the temple by the help of art&mdash;he, I say, and his poetry are not admitted; the sane man disappears and is nowhere when he enters into rivalry with the madman.</p><p>I might tell of many other noble deeds which have sprung from inspired madness. And therefore, let no one frighten or flutter us by saying that the temperate friend is to be chosen rather than the inspired, but let him further show that love is not sent by the gods for any good to lover or beloved; if he can do so we will allow him to carry off the palm. And we, on our part, will prove in answer to him that the madness of love is the greatest of heaven's blessings, and the proof shall be one which the wise will receive, and the witling disbelieve.</p></div> </div>
