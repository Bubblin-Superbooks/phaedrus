Will he not choose a beloved who is delicate rather than sturdy and strong?

But I may sum up all that I have to say in a word, and pass on. Such a person in war, or in any of the great crises of life, will be the anxiety of his friends and also of his lover, and certainly not the terror of his enemies; which nobody can deny.</p></div> </div>
