Something too of the recollections of childhood might float about them still; they might regain that old simplicity which had been theirs in other days at their first entrance on life. And although their love of one another was ever present to them, they would acknowledge also a higher love of duty and of God, which united them. And their happiness would depend upon their preserving in them this principle&mdash;not losing the ideals of justice and holiness and truth, but renewing them at the fountain of light.</p></div> </div>
